# nvimz

> A blazing-fast, minimalist Neovim configuration for DevOps engineers and backend developers.

**nvimz** is a high-performance Neovim setup optimized for **Neovim 0.12+** that prioritizes speed, structural simplicity, and developer experience. With a strict startup target under **10ms**, it replaces heavy plugin ecosystems with native APIs, the lightweight `mini.nvim` suite, and the built-in `vim.pack` package manager.

## Philosophy: Zero-Mason, Native-First

Unlike heavy configurations that rely on Mason for runtime isolation, **nvimz** expects language servers and formatters to be pre-installed in your system `$PATH`. This aligns perfectly with modern infrastructure-as-code and deterministic dotfile management:

- **Predictable & Reproducible:** Your development environment is managed deterministically by your system's package manager (`Homebrew`, `Nix`, `APT`).
- **Zero Startup Overhead:** Eliminates execution delays caused by third-party managers checking binaries at startup.
- **Native-First Stability:** Leverages Neovim 0.12+ built-in features to drastically reduce plugin surface area and minimize breaking changes.
- **Phase-Driven Loading:** Strategic use of event-driven triggers (`BufReadPre`, `InsertEnter`) and `vim.schedule` ensures the core initialization path remains completely unblocked.

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements

- **Neovim 0.12.0+**
- **System tools:** `git`, `rg` (ripgrep), `fd`
- **Optional External Binaries:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for local AI features), `stylua`, `black`, `shfmt`, `gofmt` (for formatting).

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Backup your existing configuration
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# Clone and launch nvimz
git clone [https://github.com/andev0x/nvimz.git](https://github.com/andev0x/nvimz.git) ~/.config/nvim
nvim

```

The configuration uses the built-in `vim.pack` system to manage plugins. On first launch, packages will be automatically initialized and installed.

For Arch Linux users, a dedicated installation script is available:

```bash
./scripts/arch-install
```

This script will install all necessary system dependencies via `pacman` (or `yay`/`paru` if available).

### 3. Verification & Maintenance

Run the custom built-in health check to ensure your system `$PATH` contains the required binaries for LSP and formatting:

```vim
:ToolDoctor

```

Manage your environment using native Neovim commands:

* `:PackUpdate` – Update all managed plugins.
* `:PackClean` – Remove unused plugins from your local disk.
* `:ParsersUpdate` – Download and compile Tree-sitter parsers directly via native APIs (Go, Rust, TS, Python, etc.).

## Features

### Performance & Minimalism

* **Sub-10ms Startup Time:** Achieved via strict bytecode caching and event-driven lazy loading through native `vim.pack`.
* **Ultra-Low Latency:** Optimized redraw cycles (`lazyredraw`), smooth scrolling, and throttled statusline updates to eliminate runtime frame drops.
* **Smart Resource Allocation:** Automatic Tree-sitter throttling for large files (greater than 500KB) and optimized diagnostic polling rates.
* **High-Throughput LSP:** Non-blocking attach logic and asynchronous diagnostic rendering for an instantaneous editing response.
* **Zero Ecosystem Bloat:** Replaces heavy third-party dependency chains with modules from the unified `mini.nvim` suite.
* **Bare-Metal Tree-sitter:** Interacts directly with Neovim 0.12's native syntax highlighting and folding engine without bulky wrapper plugins.

### Development Workflow

* **Fluid File Explorer:** Rapid, modal file navigation using `mini.files`. Press `a` inside the explorer to instantly create new files or folders.
* **Fuzzy Finding:** Instant search for files, live grep patterns, and buffers powered by `mini.pick`.
* **Git Operations:** Comprehensive version control tracking directly from the buffer with `mini.git` and `mini.diff`.
* **Scratch Terminal:** Instant floating shell access mapped to `<leader>t`.
* **Asynchronous Formatting:** Managed cleanly via `conform.nvim` leveraging your system's global binaries.
* **Context completion:** Lightweight, low-overhead LSP autocompletion with `mini.completion`.

### Advanced Capabilities

* **Advanced Debugging:** Pre-configured `nvim-dap` architecture complete with UI overlays and specialized Go debugging workflows.
* **Local AI Context:** Deep integration with local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) using `gp.nvim`. Includes an auto-start script if the local daemon is idle.
* **GitHub Copilot:** Native integration with `copilot.lua` for contextual inline suggestions.
* **Smart Diagnostics:** Clean diagnostic hover popups triggered gracefully on cursor-hold events.

## Customization

### Local Machine Overrides

You can declare environment-specific variables or overrides using `lua/machine/local.lua`. This isolated module is ignored by version control to prevent dotfile pollution across different development rigs.

Example structure for `lua/machine/local.lua`:

```lua
return {
    python_path = "/usr/bin/python3",
}

```

### Extending Language Servers

Incorporate new language servers by tracking them cleanly within `lua/infra/spec.lua`. Ensure the respective binary exists in your host shell `$PATH`.

```lua
M.lsp_servers = {
    gopls = {
        cmd = { "gopls" },
        filetypes = { "go" },
        root_markers = { "go.mod", ".git" },
    },
}

```

### Extending Formatters

Map additional engines inside `lua/infra/spec.lua`. They will be instantly ingested and managed downstream by `conform.nvim`.

```lua
M.formatters_by_ft = {
    lua = { "stylua" },
}

```
